# Digital KYC – Drop-Off Reduction & Conversion Improvement

This repository contains two primary files: a detailed PDF report (`Shikhamoni Borah Capstone Project 1.pdf`) and a fully implemented Jupyter Notebook (`Shikhamoni Borah - Digital KYC Drop-Off Reduction & Conversion Improvement.ipynb`). The notebook uses the dataset included as an Excel file (`Digital KYC_Reduce Drop-Off_Lift Conversion.xlsx`), which contains customer-level KYC activity, failure percentages, attempts, time taken, and error logs. Together, these files provide a complete analytical and narrative overview of the challenges within the bank’s digital KYC workflow.

The project examines why customers frequently abandon the KYC flow and why certain stages—especially document scanning and uploading—experience high failure rates. The notebook performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, KPI generation, and insight extraction. It reveals systemic patterns related to delays, scanning errors, incorrect uploads, and backend mismatches. These findings are translated into practical recommendations for improving the user experience, optimizing backend performance, and reducing both rejection and resubmission rates.

The accompanying PDF report provides a more detailed, structured explanation of the analysis. It outlines the business context, explains stage-wise issues, and presents a comprehensive recommendation framework focused on lowering abandonment, improving turnaround time, strengthening validation processes, and increasing successful KYC completion. 

Running the notebook is straightforward—open it in a Jupyter environment, execute the cells, and review the generated outputs. The repository serves as an end-to-end reference for diagnosing and improving the digital KYC journey through data-driven insights and structured problem-solving.
